# Welcome to the .NET Foundation Web Site!

This website powers <http://dotnetfoundation.org>.

## How to build this site

### Prerequisites

* You'll need something that can build .NET Core projects
* You'll need an IDE of some kind (Visual Studio or VSCode works well)
* You'll need SQL Server with localDB so that the localDB will work

### Getting the site code

* Fork this repository.
* Clone your forked repository onto your machine.

### Opening the Project

Open the project in the editor of your choice

### Installing the DB Context (TODO: Finish this section)

The site relies on a local db, so you'll need to install that to get up and running.

#### How to Build

* If you're in Visual Studio, build as you would a normal project.
* If you're on the command line, run `dotnet restore` and then `dotnet build`
